There are 5 different bots you can have. Driller, Engineer, Scout, Gunner, and Mission Control (I don't think mission control says mission control lines.)

You will need your own Token, Guild ID, and ClientID. for this to work. 
The guild ID is from your Server
The Token is for your Account. DO NOT let anyone know your Token. 

// Adding the Bot to your Discord
You need to sign up for Discord Developer and create an application.
The client ID comes from the OATH2 page
Subsiquintly you will need to use the URL generator to allow the bot onto your discord server. 
In the first section, select applications.commands and bot.
The second section, You need to select
send messages, send TTS messages, use slash commands, connect, speak, use voice activity, priority speaker.


IF you have a message that says Requires OAuth2 Code Grant go to the bot page and deselect Requires OAuth2 Code Grant under Authorization Flow.

//If you host the bot yourself and you want it to start up everytime your computer turns on.
You need to create a script with: 
cd "File location"

then turn that into a .bat file
Yo uwill then have to open 

The Voicelines folder in Driller will work for all of them.
